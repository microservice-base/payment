# Contributing

**microservice-base/payment** is an open source project, and your feedback and contributions
are needed and always welcome.

Non trivial changes should be discussed with the project maintainers by
opening a [Feature Request] clearly explaining rationale, background
and possible implementation ideas. Feel free to provide code in such
discussions.

Once the proposal is approved, a Pull Request can be opened. If you want
